# 🚀 DocuMind AI  
### LLM-Powered Intelligent Document Dashboard

DocuMind AI is a full-stack AI system that transforms raw documents into structured intelligence using OCR, NLP, vector databases, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

It enables users to upload documents and automatically extract summaries, insights, analytics, risks, action items, and perform conversational querying using Large Language Models.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Organizations deal with large volumes of documents such as contracts, research papers, invoices, medical reports, and policies. Manually extracting key information from these documents is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

There is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically understand documents and provide actionable insights in a scalable and reliable manner.

## 💡 Solution Overview

DocuMind AI provides:

- 📄 Universal document upload (PDF, images, DOCX)
- 🔍 OCR for scanned documents
- 🧠 Text chunking & embedding generation
- 📦 Vector database storage (FAISS)
- 🔎 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- 🤖 LLM-powered document querying
- 📊 Analytics dashboard
- ⚠ Risk detection
- ✅ Action item extraction
- 🔁 Document comparison
- 💬 Chat with your document
